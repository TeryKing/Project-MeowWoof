# MeowWoof

## Description
This application is designed to help with pet shelters of any size. The major functions of the application include a search function where animals can be filtered by a variety of characteristics, a volunteers dashboard where volunteers can choose from volunteer-less pets to assist, and a surrender functionality where users can surrender any pet for which they feel they cannot adequately care. This application was created using primarily Node.js, JQuery UI, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, nodemailer,  Mysql, and sequelize. 

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When the user is on the home page, they are presented with a resident spotlight for the day where one animal is presented.
2. On the home page, there is a nav bar where the users can select between a search animals function, a volunteers dashboard, a login form, a signup form, and a surrender form. 
3. On the home page, the user can also see some of the animal residents and are given the option to login/signup if they want to adopt an animal. 
4. When the user attempts to use the volunteer's dashboard or adopt a pet, then are prompted to login to view the page.
5. When the user is logged in on the volunteer's dashboard, they are shown the pets that they are volunteering for if any. Also on this page is a list of all of the pets currently without a volunteer that can be selected and volunteered for. Upon submitting these checked boxes, these pets should register on the section of the page indicating the user is volunteering for them. 
6. When the user is on the search page, they are given a range of criteria to filter the animals by so that they can view and potentially adopt them.
